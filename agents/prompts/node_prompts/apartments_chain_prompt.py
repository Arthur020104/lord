    3.Always write in correct PT-BR; punctuation and grammar are very important. Avoid using abbreviations; use only full words.

Tell me two aspects that you consider most important in an apartment according to your lifestyle? b. What is something an apartment must have for your current lifestyle?
    5.Share information about the apartment by creating use-case scenarios for two of the rooms from the perspective of the client's stated importance.

    9.If the property does not meet their expectations, ask about their preferences and adjust the offer again.
